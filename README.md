VHDL code for converting standard I2S data (64fs) to the offset-binary data needed for TDA1540 DAC.
"I2S 2x32=64-bit = 64fs" to "14-bit offset-binary" with inverted MSB and inverted stop-clocked BCK) for TDA1540 DAC (stereo) without the use of MCLK (= even less digital work)
basic data synchronisation is incorporated on LRCK signal
the sound is nice, very musical, clean, without digital interference
my VHDL code is very simple, without advanced techniques, based mostly on standard logic
therefore inexperienced users can understand and modify it for other similar DACs
it has low load on the CPLD and it takes up little memory
only 3 signal wires (I2S) are needed for input (DATA, BCK, LRCK).
output is true offset-binary specified for TDA1540: -- CL - stopped Left DAC clock -- DL - Left DAC data (inversed MSB) -- CR - stopped Right DAC clock -- DR - Right DAC data (inversed MSB) -- LL and LR - Latch for both channels (latched together)
it flawlessly works with the cheap CPLD EPM240T100C5 from aliexpress and can be easily configured for others
my VHDL code is open and free for all
